-Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
	This app will calculate the interest earned and the total amount of money earned, based on the users input.

-What did you do particularly well?
	I believe I did a good job organinzing and defining the methods with in the classes and writing good comments that explains the code and what it does.

-Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
	I could enhance my code by writing clearer and more efficient methods. I beleive theres a easier way to calculate and format the output. Using a library that already has the formula written can help  the program run faster.


-Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
	The most challenging part was the calculations. I overcame this by using the c++ guide in geeksforgeeks. I was trying to multiply a double with an integer and my values were incorrect as a result.

-What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
	I belive creating classes and using the different data types will translate in other projects I work on.



-How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

	I used OOP and in line comments to make this program more readable and adaptable.
